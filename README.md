This app was inspired by Dr. Mostafa's saad [sheet](https://goo.gl/unDETI).

In this sheet the constant performance in a problem have divided into four major timing columns reading, thinking, coding, and debugging for more info about the sheet see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3lmvYBxgwE) .

Problem timing status is a timer used for recording your timing preformance in a problem.

Your problems list are saved into your local machine and also all other data you see on this site. no external storage are used.

  

You can add, edit, mark as finshed and remove any problem from your problems list.

  

The problem id is its link i.e https://codeforces.com/contest/1480/problem/B.

You can check the app code [here](https://github.com/mahmoudAcm/problem-timing-status).
